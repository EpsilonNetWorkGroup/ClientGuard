# Why Next Generation Minecraft Anti-Cheat?
* For normal players, no annoying false positives, but of course useless if you use it together with server-side anti-cheats
* With the development of anti-cheat, you will be able to find and catch all types of cheats, for example finding ESP or scripted cheats is something that server-side anti-cheat can never do
* You can do HWID hardware ban, so that the banned cheater can no longer play on the cheated computer
# Why open source
As a reference example of client-side anti-cheating, I hope more people (service owners) will accept the installation of anti-cheating programs on the client side, In fact it's already has a lot of third-party code (mods) loaded into the player's client.  
As well as creating an anti-cheat community between players, we could disallow players who don't have anti-cheat installed to play with those who do (similar to CSGO's priority mechanism)  
Developed in China, currently in the popular game people are believed that the Chinese love to cheat, generally bring hate attitude, hope anti-cheating can do a good job
# How to use?
No, customer anti-cheat is not a universal solution, please develop it according to your needs, this is just an example for reference.
